# CampusQueue – CS157A Team 10

CampusQueue is a web-based campus service wait-time platform for CS157A. It lets students view current and predicted wait times for campus services, submit check-ins/check-outs, and use historical trends to decide when to visit. Staff can manage assigned services and validate activity, while administrators can manage services, staff assignments, users, and audit logs.

This project uses beginner-friendly Java/JSP/Servlet/JDBC code and a MySQL database. The implementation is intentionally simple enough for an introductory database management systems course while still covering the required database, role, and application functionality.

## Recommended Demo Accounts

These are created by `sql/demo_accounts.sql`, which is run automatically by `scripts/setup_db_mac.sh`.

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Student | `student.demo@sjsu.edu` | `pass123` |
| Staff | `staff.demo@sjsu.edu` | `pass123` |
| Admin | `admin.demo@sjsu.edu` | `pass123` |

The staff demo account is assigned to **SRAC Gym** so staff functionality can be demonstrated immediately.

Backup sample accounts also exist:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Student | `john.doe@sjsu.edu` | `pass123` |
| Staff | `suparn.posina@sjsu.edu` | `pass123` |
| Admin | `stephen.curry@sjsu.edu` | `pass123` |

## Local Setup and Run Instructions

The tested local setup uses:

- Tomcat 10 at `/Users/oops/Downloads/tomcat10`
- MySQL database named `team10`
- MySQL connector jar either in the project or in Tomcat's `lib` folder

### 1. Clone the fork

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p campusqueue-testing
cd campusqueue-testing
git clone https://github.com/oops408/CS157A-S2-team-10.git campusqueue-fork
cd campusqueue-fork
```

### 2. Set environment variables

```bash
export TOMCAT_HOME="/Users/oops/Downloads/tomcat10"
export CATALINA_HOME="$TOMCAT_HOME"
export DB_USER="root"
export DB_PASSWORD="campusqueue123"
export DB_URL="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/team10?serverTimezone=UTC"
```

If your local MySQL root password is different, replace `campusqueue123` with your actual MySQL password.

### 3. Rebuild and verify the database

```bash
sh scripts/setup_db_mac.sh
```

This script runs:

```bash
mysql -u root -p < sql/schema.sql
mysql -u root -p team10 < sql/upgrade_basic_features.sql
mysql -u root -p team10 < sql/demo_accounts.sql
mysql -u root -p team10 < sql/test_basic_features.sql
```

### 4. Compile and deploy to Tomcat

```bash
sh scripts/build_deploy_mac.sh
```

The deploy script:

- Finds Tomcat 10 using `TOMCAT_HOME`.
- Uses the MySQL connector jar from either the project or Tomcat `lib` folder.
- Compiles all Java source files into `build/classes`.
- Deploys the app as `CampusQueue`.
- Copies compiled classes into `WEB-INF/classes`.
- Copies the MySQL connector into `WEB-INF/lib`.
- Restarts Tomcat.

### 5. Open the app

```text
http://localhost:8080/CampusQueue/HomeServlet
```

## Demo Flow

### Student Demo

1. Log in as `student.demo@sjsu.edu`.
2. View services and predicted wait times.
3. Filter services by category.
4. Open a service detail page.
5. Submit a check-in.
6. Attempt a second active check-in and confirm it is blocked.
7. Submit check-out and confirm duration/history updates.

### Staff Demo

1. Log in as `staff.demo@sjsu.edu`.
2. Confirm only assigned service(s) appear.
3. Update service status/capacity.
4. Update service hours.
5. Validate or flag a check-in.
6. Confirm validation history updates.

### Admin Demo

1. Log in as `admin.demo@sjsu.edu`.
2. Add a test service.
3. Edit that service.
4. Deactivate that service.
5. Remove that test service.
6. Assign staff to a service.
7. Suspend and reactivate a user.
8. View audit logs.

## Database Design Coverage

The database includes the required entity tables:

- `Users`, `Student`, `Staff`, `Admin`
- `ServiceCategory`, `Service`, `ServiceHours`
- `CheckIn`, `StaffAssignment`, `ValidationLog`, `WaitTimeHistory`, `AuditLog`

It also includes relationship tables from the ERD/report:

- `IsA`, `Categorizes`, `HasHours`, `Submits`, `OccursAt`, `Manages`, `AssignedTo`, `Covers`, `Records`, `Validates`, `Flags`, `Performs`

The application keeps relationship tables synchronized during runtime actions:

- New check-ins update `CheckIn`, `Submits`, and `OccursAt`.
- Staff assignments update `StaffAssignment`, `AssignedTo`, `Covers`, and `Manages`.
- Validations update `ValidationLog`, `Validates`, and `Flags`.
- Audit actions update `AuditLog` and `Performs`.

---

## Security and Access Control

- Passwords are not stored as plain text for new registrations.
- `PasswordUtil` hashes new passwords with SHA-256.
- Old demo passwords like `pass123` are accepted once and upgraded to hashes after login.
- Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- `AuthFilter` protects student, staff, and admin routes.
- Staff actions are checked server-side so staff can only update/validate assigned services.
- Admins can suspend/reactivate accounts using account status.

---

## Important Notes

- Use **Tomcat 10**, because the Java code uses `jakarta.servlet` imports.
- In zsh/macOS terminal, use forward slashes such as `sql/schema.sql`, not Windows backslashes.
- If MySQL says access denied, the local MySQL password does not match `DB_PASSWORD`.
- The project is intentionally implemented with plain Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and SQL for an intro DBMS class.
